# Drake Hotline Bling Meme Generator ðŸ“žðŸ’ƒ

This project is a Drake Hotline Bling meme generator using GPT-4 and Streamlit. The generator takes a user's input and generates a meme with two options, where the first option is less desirable and the second option is more desirable.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Streamlit app with the command `streamlit run chat.py`.

When the Streamlit app opens in your browser, you can enter a topic in the input field, and the app will generate a meme based on that topic. The meme will be displayed on the screen, and you can create as many memes as you want by entering different topics.

## Project Structure

- `chat.py`: This is the main Streamlit app file that contains the code for generating memes and displaying them.

## Technologies Used

- GPT-4: OpenAI's advanced language model that generates the text for the memes.
- Streamlit: A Python library for creating beautiful and interactive web apps.
- Imgflip API: The API used to create meme images using the generated text.
